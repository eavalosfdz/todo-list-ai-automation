# Todo List App with AI Integration

A modern, feature-rich todo list application built with Next.js and enhanced with AI capabilities. This project demonstrates the integration of multiple technologies to create a comprehensive task management solution.

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Core Application

The project began with a simple Next.js todo list application featuring basic CRUD operations. Users could add, edit, delete, and mark todos as completed. The interface included dark/light mode toggle and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

### Phase 2: Database Integration

Supabase was integrated as the backend database solution, providing real-time data persistence and user authentication. The database schema was designed to support user-specific todo lists with proper relationships and security policies.

### Phase 3: AI Enhancement

OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo was integrated to provide intelligent todo suggestions and enhancements. The AI service analyzes user input and generates detailed, actionable todo descriptions with priority recommendations and step-by-step breakdowns.

### Phase 4: In-App Chatbot

A conversational AI interface was added, allowing users to interact with the AI assistant directly within the application. The chatbot provides natural language processing for todo creation and management, with conversation persistence and smart suggestions.

## Development Approach

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. Each feature was developed incrementally, ensuring stability and maintainability. The AI integration was designed to gracefully fall back to keyword-based enhancement when the service is unavailable, providing a consistent user experience.

The WhatsApp integration demonstrates how modern web applications can extend their functionality to popular messaging platforms, creating a bridge between traditional web interfaces and mobile-first communication channels.

This project showcases the potential of combining modern web technologies with AI services and messaging platforms to create comprehensive, user-friendly applications that adapt to various user preferences and interaction patterns.
